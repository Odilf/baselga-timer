# Baselga time transform

Sir Baselga is known for being inaccurate. The baselga timer implements a Lorentz-Odilf transfrom (the Lorentz transform being, of course, the equation to correct for Einstein's spacetime dilation) to achieve the most accurate time current technology can offer.

The Lorentz-Odilf transforms incorporates the latests findings of physics, chemestry, geology, biochemestry, biology, botany, zoology and furry science.
